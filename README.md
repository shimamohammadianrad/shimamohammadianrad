### Hi there, I'm Shima Mohammadian Rad üëã

I'm a product designer and visual designer with over 7 years of experience working with various clients and industries, including OTP generator, crypto, e-commerce, and shipment tracking. I'm passionate about creating products and designs that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.

- In addition to my design work, I've spent 2 years mentoring other designers through ADPList. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me, as I've been able to help designers grow their skills, build their confidence, and achieve their career goals. Mentoring has also taught me a lot about communication, leadership, and empathy, which are crucial skills for any designer.

- Currently, I'm working on my own website, where I showcase my design work, share my thoughts on design and UX, and provide a way for people to get in touch with me. My website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's hosted on GitHub Pages.

- In the future, I plan to create my own products and continue focusing on mentoring. I believe that building my own products will give me the opportunity to apply my design skills and create solutions that have a positive impact on people's lives. And mentoring will allow me to help more designers reach their full potential.
