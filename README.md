## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product designer and visual designer with over 7 years of experience working with various clients and industries, including OTP generator, crypto, e-commerce, and shipment tracking. I'm passionate about creating products and designs that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.

In addition to my design work, I've spent 2 years mentoring other designers through ADPList. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me, as I've been able to help designers grow their skills, build their confidence, and achieve their career goals. Mentoring has also taught me a lot about communication, leadership, and empathy, which are crucial skills for any designer.
